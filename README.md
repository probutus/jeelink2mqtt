# jeelink2mqtt
simple python scrpt which transforms temperature and humidy data to MQTT server

I was looking for a simple solution to have my temperature sensors independant from my home automation system. Every solution I found sofar was either too complex or did not fit my needs. 

If you are looking for an all-inclusive comfortable solution please go somewhere else. This is ugly code I created while binge drinking. You have been warned.

The whole server consists of one python file.

Setting of server, sensor names is all in the top of the python file. You are free to do whatever you like with it but use at your own risk and dont blame me.
